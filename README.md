The observations that can be made from plotting the predicted veloicty aginast the radius and the velocity against the radius is that 
the predicted velocity is very similair in shape but the actual magnitude of values is much larger. It can also be observed that once the velocity against radius line has reached its maximum it begins to steadily decrease, however, the predicted velocity against velocity line starts to plato (more than the other line) after its maximum.
