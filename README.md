The observations that can be made from plotting the predicted veloicty aginast the radius and the velocity against the radius is that 
the predicted velocity is very similair in shape but the actual magnitude of values is much larger, hence, when plotted on the same
graph you cannot actually see the shape of the velocity against radius graph. The prdicted velocity has a steep drop (and a steep rise)
between where the radius is approximately 18 kPc and 20 kPc. The predicted velocity does reach zero at approximately 19 kPc.
